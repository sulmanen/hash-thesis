abstract = {In this paper, we introduce KAZE features, a novelmultiscale 2D fea- ture detection and description algorithm in nonlinear scale spaces. Previous ap- proaches detect and describe features at different scale levels by building or ap- proximating the Gaussian scale space of an image. However, Gaussian blurring does not respect the natural boundaries of objects and smoothes to the same de- gree both details and noise, reducing localization accuracy and distinctiveness. In contrast, we detect and describe 2D features in a nonlinear scale space by means of nonlinear diffusion filtering. In thisway, we can make blurring locally adaptive to the image data, reducing noise but retaining object boundaries, obtaining su- perior localization accuracy and distinctiviness. The nonlinear scale space is built using efficient Additive Operator Splitting (AOS) techniques and variable con- ductance diffusion. We present an extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets and a practical matching application on deformable surfaces. Even though our features are somewhat more expensive to compute than SURF due to the con- struction of the nonlinear scale space, but comparable to SIFT, our results reveal a step forward in performance both in detection and description against previous state-of-the-art methods.},

The bits are extracted by thresholding projections onto random smooth patterns generated from a user-specified key. The extracted bits are further utilized to synthesize a Gaussian pseudo-random sequence that changes continuously with the image block yet depends sensitively on the secret key. The proposed technique is quite general and can be combined with the majority of oblivious watermarking schemes that generate watermarks from pseudo-random sequences.

abstract = {There are two popular ways to implement anisotropic diffusion filters with a diffusion tensor: Explicit finite difference schemes are simple but become inefficient due to severe time step size restrictions, while semi-implicit schemes are more efficient but require to solve large linear systems of equations. In our paper we present a novel class of algorithms that combine the advantages of both worlds: They are based on simple explicit schemes, while being more efficient than semi-implicit approaches. These so-called fast explicit diffusion (FED) schemes perform cycles of explicit schemes with varying time step sizes that may violate the stability restriction in up to 50 percent of all cases. FED schemes can be motivated from a decomposition of box filters in terms of explicit schemes for linear diffusion problems. Experiments demonstrate the advantages of the FED approach for time-dependent (parabolic) image enhancement problems as well as for steady state (elliptic) image compression tasks. In the latter case FED schemes are speeded up substantially by embedding them in a cascadic coarse-to-fine approach.},

We first propose a simple yet efficient way of aggregating local image descriptors into a vector of limited dimension, which can be viewed as a simplification of the Fisher kernel representation. We then show how to jointly optimize the dimension reduction and the indexing algorithm, so that it best preserves the quality of vector comparison. The evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art: the search accuracy is comparable to the bag-of-features approach for an image representation that fits in 20 bytes.

abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},

abstract = {Within the field of pattern classification, the Fisher kernel is a powerful framework which combines the strengths of generative and discriminative approaches. The idea is to characterize a signal with a gradient vector derived from a generative probability model and to subsequently feed this representation to a discriminative classifier. We propose to apply this framework to image categorization where the input signals are images and where the underlying generative model is a visual vocabulary: a Gaussian mixture model which approximates the distribution of low-level features in images. We show that Fisher kernels can actually be understood as an extension of the popular bag-of-visterms. Our approach demonstrates excellent performance on two challenging databases: an in-house database of 19 object/scene categories and the recently released VOC 2006 database. It is also very practical: it has low computational needs both at training and test time and vocabularies trained on one set of categories can be applied to another set without any significant loss in performance.},

The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used.

abstract = {Perceptual image hash functions produce hash values based on the image's visual appearance. A perceptual hash can also be referred to as e.g. a robust hash or a ngerprint. Such a function calculates similar hash values for similar images, whereas for dissimilar images dissimilar hash values are calculated. Finally, using an adequate distance or similarity function to compare two perceptual hash values, it can be decided whether two images are perceptually di erent or not. Perceptual image hash functions can be used e.g. for the identi cation or integrity veri cation of images. This thesis proposes a novel benchmarking framework, called Rihamark, for perceptual image hash functions. Subsequently, four di erent percep- tual image hash functions were benchmarked: A discrete Cosine transform (DCT) based , a Marr-Hildreth operator based, a radial variance based and a block mean value based image hash function. pHash, an open source im- plementation of various perceptual hash functions, was used to benchmark the rst three functions. The latter, the block mean value based image hash function was implemented by the author of this thesis himself. The block mean value based image hash function outperforms the other hash functions in terms of speed. The DCT based image hash function is the slowest. Although the Marr-Hildreth operator based image hash function is not the fastest nor the most robust, it o ers by far the best discriminiative abilities. Interestingly enough, the performance in terms of discriminiative ability does not depend on the content of the images. That is, no matter whether the visual appearance of the images compared was very similar or not, the performance of the particular hash function did not change sig- ni cantly. Di erent image operations, like horizontal ipping, rotating or resizing, were used to test the robustness of the image hash functions. An interesting result is that none of the tested image hash function is robust against ipping an image horizontally.},
